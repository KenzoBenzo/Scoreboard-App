# Scoreboard-App

Taught by Jim Hoskins, a software engineer at AirBnb on Treehouse.

This course was very difficult coming in with out ever having touched the React library before. However, I found the modularity & consistency of the code to be mostly logical. The scoreboard app itself

This basic scoreboard application is designed as a beginner application to understand the basics of React such as:

* Components | a self contained reusable piece of an interface
* Stateful Components | allows components to update according to changes
* Props | parameters that customize a component
* Bind | event handlers and functions passed down as properties
* Ternary conditional operator | a conditional JavaScript operator that takes 3 operands
* Life Cycle Methods | One is called component did mount (componentDidMount). This is good for timers & data fetching.
